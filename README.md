#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.

1. Driving Innovation - Software engineering is essential for driving innovation in various fields, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
2. Ensuring Reliability and Security - In an increasingly digital world, the reliability and security of software are paramount. Software engineers play a crucial role in building systems that are both dependable and secure
3. Supporting Business Operations - Businesses rely on software to manage their operations, from customer relationship management (CRM) systems to enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Software engineers develop and maintain these critical systems
4. Enhances Scalability & Maintainability
Well-structured software is easier to scale and update, ensuring long-term usability and adaptability to changing business or user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The "Software Crisis" and the Rise of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s) - In the early days of computing, software development was often ad-hoc, leading to projects that were late, over budget, and unreliable. This period was known as the "software crisis."
In response, structured programming emerged, emphasizing disciplined approaches to coding. This involved breaking down programs into smaller, manageable modules, using control structures, and focusing on readability and maintainability.
This milestone marked a shift from "coding as art" to "coding as engineering," laying the foundation for more systematic software development.

2. The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s):
Object-oriented programming revolutionized software design by introducing the concept of "objects," which combine data and behavior.
OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism enabled developers to create more complex and reusable code.
Languages like C++ and Java gained popularity, fostering a new era of software development focused on modularity and scalability.

3. The Internet Age and Agile Development (1990s-2000s):
The rise of the internet transformed software development, leading to the creation of web applications and distributed systems.
Traditional waterfall development models proved inadequate for the rapid pace of internet development.
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emerged, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change.
This shift in methodology allowed software to be created in quicker more adaptable ways, that better fit the ever changing landscape of the internet. 
   

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
step 1: Planning/Requirements Gathering:
This initial phase focuses on defining the project's scope, goals, and requirements. It involves gathering input from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. Key activities include feasibility studies, requirements analysis, and creating a project plan.

step 2: Design:
In this phase, the software's architecture and design are created. This involves outlining how the software will function, including user interfaces, databases, and system interactions. The outcome is a detailed design specification that serves as a blueprint for development.
step 3: Implementation/Development:
This is where the actual coding takes place. Developers translate the design specifications into functional software using programming languages. This phase involves writing code, building databases, and integrating various software components.
step 4: Testing:
Testing is crucial for identifying and fixing bugs and ensuring that the software meets quality standards.
Various testing methods are employed, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
step 5: Deployment:
Once the software has been thoroughly tested, it's deployed to the production environment, making it available to end-users.
Deployment may involve various strategies, such as phased rollouts or full-scale launches.
step 6: Maintenance:
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, which involves ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates.
This phase ensures that the software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:
Description:
The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach. Each phase of the SDLC (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) is completed before the next one begins.   
It emphasizes thorough planning and documentation upfront.   
Changes are difficult and costly to implement once a phase is completed. 
Appropriate Scenarios:
Projects with well-defined, stable requirements.
Projects where changes are expected to be minimal.
Projects with strict regulatory requirements (e.g., government projects, medical devices).

Agile Methodology:
Description:
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach.   
It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to change.   
Projects are broken down into small, manageable iterations (sprints).   
Customer feedback is incorporated throughout the development process.

Appropriate Scenarios:
Projects with evolving or unclear requirements.
Projects where frequent changes are expected.
Projects that require rapid development and deployment.
Projects where customer feedback is crucial.
Example: developing a mobile app, or creating a website that needs to adapt quickly to market trends.
 Differences:
 
Flexibility:
-Agile: Highly flexible, and adaptable to change.   
Waterfall: Rigid, changes are difficult to implement.
Customer Involvement:
-Agile: Continuous customer involvement throughout the project.   
Waterfall: Customer involvement primarily at the beginning and end.

Development Process:
Agile: Iterative and incremental.   
Waterfall: Linear and sequential.
Risk Management:
Agile: Risks are identified and mitigated throughout the project.   
Waterfall: Risks may not be identified until later stages.
 
Documentation:
Agile: documentation is created as needed, focusing on working software.   
Waterfall: heavy emphasis on complete documentation at each phase.

 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
   
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager -  Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode). 
importance:
- Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
- An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
- IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
- An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
- The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
- Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
- Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
- Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
- Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

- Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
- Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
- System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
- Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

rovide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. 

Draw a picture of a person - Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
